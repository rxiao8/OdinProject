            <h3>Color & Background-color</h3>
            <p>There are multiple ways to color the elements.
                <ol>
                    <li>hex</li>
                    <li>rgb</li>
                    <li>hsl</li>
                    <li>name</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Typography & Text-alignment</h3>
            <p>There are different ways to style the font based on family, size, weight, and alignment.  For font family, the first listed will be used unless the browser cannot find or support it. Therefore, it is best practice to have a list of "font familys" and generic family.
                <ul>
                    <li>font family</li>
                    <li>font size</li>
                    <li>font weight</li>
                    <li>center</li>
                    <li>left</li>
                    <li>right</li>
                    <li>justified</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Image Edits</h3>
            <p>By default, the size of the images will be their orignal sizes. One way to resize is to define one dimension and have the others set to auto. A best practice is to explicitly state the height and width even if you don't plan to adjust them since it will leave a blank space if the image was not able to load properly. The blank space is reserved.</p>
